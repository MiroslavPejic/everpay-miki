# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

1) First run the init.sh script to set up env variables (I wouldnt do it like this normally but this is just a test app)
### `init.sh`

2) Run this script next to start the backend and frontend
### `start-apps.sh`

3) Run this if you want to stop the apps
### `stop-apps.sh`
